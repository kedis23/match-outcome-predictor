# match-outcome-predictor
an example of a python program that predicts the winner of the World Cup based on various stats:

This code creates a Flask app that includes a route to render the home page, and a route to predict the winner of a game. It also includes two templates (home.html and result.html) to render the user interface and the prediction result in a user-friendly format.

This is still a very simple example, and a more advanced app could include additional features and functionality, such as user authentication and authorization, customizable settings and preferences, and interactive visualizations of the data and predictions. To implement these features, you would need to use a combination of python programming language and a suitable framework, as well
